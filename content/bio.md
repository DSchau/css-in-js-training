Dustin has been lucky enough to specialize in front-end development pretty much his entire career, which means he's seen the gamut of CSS soutions from vanilla CSS, Sass, Less, CSS Modules, and of course, CSS in JS. He's the creator of [css-in-js-playground][css-in-js-playground], and when he isn't tinkering on some side project, he'll most likely be traveling or at least dreaming of traveling.
