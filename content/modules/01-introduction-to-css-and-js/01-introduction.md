<!-- INSERT HOOK HERE -->

CSS in JS techniques seem to be taking the frontend ecosystem by storm, as these libraries and techniques claim to solve _real_ problems with CSS. As with an increasing number of frontend trends, is this a storm that will be weathered by more traditional approaches (like CSS), or is there some real validity to CSS in JS and can utilizing these approaches have _real_ benefits to your frontend applications?

The problems CSS in JS libraries attempt to solve are problems that many of us have personally faced, consider the following problems:

1.  Scoping styles to individual components
    * Anyone who has worked on a large application has likely run into issues when a separate class name conflicts with your component!
    * _why is this button red I never made it red!!!_
1.  Theming your application (e.g. a dark and light mode!)
1.  Making components easily style-able (extensible!) and usable easily
    * A component library has never been simpler than with CSS in JS libraries

In this course, you'll gain greater insight into not only _how_ CSS in JS solves these problems (and more!) but you'll leave with an understanding of how to use the library [styled-components][styled-components] to implement CSS in JS techniques cleanly all the while solving some problems you may not have even known you had!
