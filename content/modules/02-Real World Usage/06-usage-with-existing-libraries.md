title: Usage with Existing Libraries
description: "Very few code bases get to be entirely new development. Given something like Bootstrap, Foundation, etc. how can we instrument CSS in JS while still allowing the usage of these component libraries?"

I truly wish each of us lived in a greenfield utopia where we have the luxury of writing entirely new, custom components that fit each and every use case of our application and users. However, this fairly-tale utopia is unfortunately not the type of applications that most of us develop. We live in a world where it's _extremely_ likely that we'll be building and iterating upon an existing component library. Bootstrap, Foundation, Material, and more are common component libraries that we use to get a jump-start on development.

But how does that jive with CSS in JS? How do we use these approaches that are incredibly reliant on class names and other traditional CSS approaches?

Well... as you may have guessed, you're in luck!
